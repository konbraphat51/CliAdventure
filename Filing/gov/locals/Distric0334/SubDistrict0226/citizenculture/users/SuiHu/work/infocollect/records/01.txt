Headline: Public Bench Warms Itself Too Early, Startles Morning Pigeons

District 0334/0226 — A community smart-bench located near the Old Synth-Fountain at Juno Square reportedly activated its auto-warming feature two hours ahead of schedule this morning, gently startling a flock of memory-tagged pigeons that had been napping nearby.

The bench, Model 9X-Repose by OmniSit Co., is programmed to warm in sync with pedestrian flow patterns, but a minor glitch in the ambient body-heat sensing array triggered an early activation cycle. The temperature rose to a cozy 28.5°C at approximately 05:11 SGT.

"I walked by on my way to the hydration kiosk and saw the pigeons flap up all annoyed, like they'd just gotten out of a warm bath," said local café courier Remi Jax, adding, "It smelled like toasted moss for a second."

OmniSit Co. has acknowledged the issue and issued a light-hearted statement via microburst: “Our benches just love mornings. A little too much, perhaps.”

No humans were seated at the time of the event. District Botanics confirms the nearby succulents were unharmed.
