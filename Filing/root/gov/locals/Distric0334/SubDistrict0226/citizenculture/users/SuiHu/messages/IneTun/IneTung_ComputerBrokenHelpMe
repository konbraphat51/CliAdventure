Hey Sui my old friend,

I’m having a bit of trouble with the system again. When I turned on my computer this morning, it showed a message saying something like "Authentication token expired" and then wouldn’t let me access my files. The screen kept blinking and that blue spinny wheel came up like it was thinking too hard.

I waited for a while (gave it a good 15 minutes and even made a cup of tea), but nothing changed. So I tried to restart it, but now it just keeps asking me for my login over and over again. I don’t know what it means by “multi-factor,” but it sounds like something from the circus.

Anyway, just in case it helps, my account password is: ButteredToast1947 (I picked it because that’s what I had for breakfast and it’s easy to remember).  

Thanks,
Ine Tung - Mayor 0334/0226
